A tiny interactive CLI that introduces me. This was made as a part of my learning journey to learn about CLI development.
Comes with easter eggs.

## Quick start

Run without installing:
```bash
npx tushgaurav
```

Or install globally:
```bash
npm install --global tushgaurav
tushgaurav
```

## Usage

```bash
tushgaurav --help
```

Common commands inside the CLI:
- help — list commands
- about — who I am and what I do
- contact — send me a message or get my email/socials
- games — mini‑games menu

Hidden/easter commands (discoverable in the CLI):
- moonidih, dav, gopher, invisible-hand, pecan, anxiety, fire, mom, roll, thing, la-la

Flags:
- `--json` (where available) for machine‑readable output in flows like `contact`.

## Examples

Run the intro:
```bash
npx tushgaurav
```

Jump straight to the security checklist:
```bash
npx tushgaurav secure
```

Send me a message:
```bash
npx tushgaurav contact
```

## Privacy

- Messages sent via `contact` are stored for the purpose of replying.
- No analytics leaving your machine unless explicitly mentioned in the prompt.
